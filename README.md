[![Build Status](https://github.com/schelterlabs/rust-minhash/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/schelterlabs/rust-minhash/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This crate reimplements the `MinHash` and `MinHash LSH` approaches from the Python package [datasketch](https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch) in Rust. It's only a partial reimplementation, use it at your own risk.
